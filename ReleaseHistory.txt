Version 0.3.0
* Container for insider updates added
* Container for analyst estimates added
* Container for personal portfolios added
* All the examples can use specially crafted containers with proper member names instead of 
  iterating through serde_json::Value types. This justifies the increase of the minor
  version number instead of only a patch version numbers.
  For future version, it is planed to replace type `String` by some date type where appropriate.
  Another additional type might be percentage numbers (currently also `String`). Also, using
  the adapter in praxis will show if some containers need to be adjusted (e.g. make some
  container members optional).
